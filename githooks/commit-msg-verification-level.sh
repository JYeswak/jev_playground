# commit-msg-verification-level.sh — a commit subject must say what it PROVED, or it is refused.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 2026-08-22 from the Dicklesworthstone mirror: franken_lean shipped
# 1,353 commits in 24 h, avg 1.0 file / 61 lines, and 227 of the subjects literally say
# "code-first, batch-test pending". frankensqlite: "lexer-level-verified only". The subject
# carries the epistemic state of the commit, so the ledger never overclaims. Ours said
# "verified" with no level, and four gates shipped that night with a verdict they could not
# distinguish from its opposite (docs-staleness, composer_nonempty, check-lock, UNRUN→red).
#
# Jeff, in his own pre-commit header: "It is a missing mechanism, not a knowledge gap. Four
# separate agents violated the rule on 2026-07-25 alone, each of whom knew it and had followed
# it correctly earlier the same day... nothing fails at commit time, and the agent who forgets
# is never the one who sees the red." This is the mechanism.
#
# THE LEVELS, rank-ordered. A subject claims exactly one. Higher is stronger.
#   pending    code-first, nothing run            (Jeff: "code-first, batch-test pending")
#   selftest   the gate's own --selftest passed
#   test       the suite is green
#   mutation   named killers die on a planted mutant
#   oracle     differential against the named external reference (oracles.tsv row)
#   live       firing where it runs, observed in the production ledger
#
# FORM. Either `[level]` anywhere in the subject, or the Jeff-style prose tail
# `(…, <level> pending)` / `<level>-verified`. Merge commits, reverts, and fixups are exempt
# (they carry no new claim). A subject with NO level is refused with the list.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED. A malformed or unreadable message file refuses. An empty level list is an
# authoring error and refuses. --selftest proves both legs: known-bad refused, known-good passed.
