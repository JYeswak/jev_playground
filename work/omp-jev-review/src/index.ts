/**
 * omp-jev-review — observe-only review scorer for omp.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE CALLS JEV, WHEN omp-jev-harm AND omp-jev-preaction DO NOT.
 * Those gates were measured against a live model and WON: four regexes beat Jev 12/12 to 11/12
 * at FP 0/38, so paying an API call per bash was a cost-benefit loss. That was a ruling about
 * ONE SURFACE, not a ban on the model.
 *
 * This surface is the opposite case. "Does this diff deserve review attention?" has no cheap
 * expression — there is no regex for `this refactor silently changed a default`. A judge earns
 * its seat exactly where a rule cannot be written, which is the premise of the lane.
 *
 * Upstream `jev-review` is RUN at 13/13 offline
 * (docs/demos/upstream-repro/jev-review-real-diffs-20260919.md).
 *
 * NEVER blocks. NEVER throws into the host. Returns undefined on every path.
 * A failed call records `review_error`, never a pass — NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE R40: a crashed
 * classifier recording a pass is indistinguishable from a clean result.
